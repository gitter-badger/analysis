# Acknowledgments
- `topology.v` and `normedtype.v` contain a reimplementation of file
  `Hierarchy.v` from the library Coquelicot by Sylvie Boldo, Catherine Lelay,
  and Guillaume Melquiond (http://coquelicot.saclay.inria.fr/)
- our proof of Zorn's Lemma in `set.v` is a reimplementation of the one by
  Daniel Schepler (https://github.com/coq-contribs/zorns-lemma); we also took
  inspiration from his work on topology
  (https://github.com/coq-contribs/topology) for parts of `topology.v`
